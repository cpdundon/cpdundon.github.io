This week, I spun up my first cloud database – not very difficult after all – and followed with a bunch of firsts:
* First DB function
* First DB trigger
* First DB stored procedure

It was a banner week.  By Sunday night, my test DB was all set and running with full CRUD.  What will next week hold?  I am going to hook all this database technology up to Node.js and start loading information into the database I spent this week tuning.  Once I can do that, I can build a feature that will look for new data and load the data cache several times a day.  Auto-loading a cloud database will solve my problem of over taxing the API chosen for this application.

Most of my recent work is centered around the AWS cloud universe.  I am having a great time in the AWS sandbox.  AWS offers certification and I am going to study for exams.  AWS Developer – Associate is a great place to start.  Within a year from today, I think I can move from Associate to Professional.  Now that I’ve said it, I am off to the races.

As always, do not forget to watch my Sprint cards at:
