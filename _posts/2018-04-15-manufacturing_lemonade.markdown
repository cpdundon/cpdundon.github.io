I read a lot of self-help books authored by Norman Vincent Peale, Jeffrey Gitomer, Dale Carnegie… I am planning to give Napoleon Hill a read soon. These wise men/women share many concepts. One of the most important things I have found in their work is:

When life dumps a bucket of lemons in your lap, make lemonade. I really like lemonade. It is one of the greatest inventions since sliced bread. Here is the problem, it is often unclear how to take a raw mess and generate a delicious elixir. If you cannot quaff it with a smile, you have not handled the situation properly.

Now for the specifics:

On Monday April 16th, 2018 – this Monday – my family will lay my grandmother (Granny) to rest. She lived for 99 years, just 45 days shy of the fabled century mark. I idolized her. She always had answers and good ones at that. The Great Granny was sure to make 100. She would see my return to professional software development.  I was wrong and it is time to come to grips with the loss.

What is the path to lemonade?

* My coding has ground to a halt. This is not good.
* I spent several evenings studying the Bible. Bible study is time well spent. It soothes my mind.
* Blogging is healthy and I am doing it.
* I received an outpouring of support from friends via direct contact, Facebook, text, … Their support is tremendous.
* Granny will be buried tomorrow. I expect that the celebration of her life will reset my spirits.
* My family is with me and this is good. We come together during the tough times and forge forward.

Is that enough? I need to claw back my open mind and my positive demeanor. It is time to stay very busy with something / anything really. Snoozing is not a good idea. When my code appetite returns – when I am coding 6+ hours per day – then I am out of the woods.

I will look back on my 40+ years with Granny and smile. No, not smile – beam. She has a place in my heart that few will rival.
