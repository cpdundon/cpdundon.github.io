**Progress To Date:**

After two weeks at the Flatiron School, I am spending about 5 hours per day immersed in code.  It feels great and I am learning new concepts.  For example, the curriculum covers the Yield key word in Ruby.  It is a big part of programmatic iteration.  While I had used programmatic iteration in the past, I did not know how it worked under the hood.  Now, I do.  FS showed me how to make tasty iteration sausage.

I am very happy to be learning new things and am also looking forward to re-entering the workforce.  How long is school going to take?  To date, I have made good progress and am on track to finish the program in about 3 months.  I am working to build my daily code commitment to 6.5 hours – a 30% improvement.  The added time will help ensure that I finish up the curriculum in 3 months or less.

You might wonder, how many days per week I am working?  About 5.5.  I work every day of the regular week and a half day on Saturday.  

**My Thoughts:**

What has my experience brought to the table as I work though this course?  I know the basics of how to code.  This speeds up the basic and intermediate work.  I have worked in many fields and that provided several perspectives on software.  Perspective is rather handy when breaking down a problem.

What has the Flatiron School coursework taught me?  My knowledge of strategic and tactical coding has grown.  For example, I have learned the value of proper unit testing and the detail of iterator code.  

I am utilizing self-discipline.  My time-line for course completion is tight and steady progress is required.  In the web curriculum, we do not have classroom structure – my schedule is in my hands.  It is tempting to adopt Wimpy’s attitude and say to yourself “I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.”  Delaying delivery is a recipe for disaster.  It could triple my time-line and cost 6 months of job opportunities.  

I am closely tracking my progress against a reference Flatiron time-line.  This blog will report the results.

Thank you for reading and happy coding!
