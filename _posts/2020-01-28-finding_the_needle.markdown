Okay!  I need a job and am trained as a software developer.  As such, I am putting on the full court press to find a development slot where I can grow into a tremendous technologist.  Do you know anyone who could help me with my search?  I’d like to arrange an informational interview with that person.  Contact me at chris.dundon@gmail.com to learn more.

I am working with my network – it’s a solid network – to arrange informational interviews.  The more people I meet the closer I am to the needle in the hay stack (aka employment).

Please follow my progress at:

What will my outreach stats look like when I find employment?  Let me know.  I will post the estimates.  The person that is closest to the “External Chats” count without going over will win a $100 gift certificate to their favorite restaurant.  

Caveats… 2 winners maximum.  An External Chat has a real time interactive voice component – phone call, video call, in person meeting, etc.  I will bucket the interactions.

Happy New Year – Here is to 2020!!!
