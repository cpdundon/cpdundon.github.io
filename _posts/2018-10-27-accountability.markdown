Inquiring minds want to know:
* What is my status in the Flatiron Web Development course?  
* When will the coursework be complete?  

I have crashed through several personal deadlines.  This is rather frustrating.  After some thought, I am missing accountability.  Education is a tortoise (not a hare) business.  I need consistent small victories.

As a result, I have generated a progress document that I will update daily.  Similar to a daily stand-up meeting.  I expect this new approach to guide me to a soft landing on 31-December-2018.  31-Dec is my finish goal and I am going to hit it.
