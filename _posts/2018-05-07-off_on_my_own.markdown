The CLI-Scrape-Gem lab exceeded my expectations.  It was hard!  It is 3AM Sunday night / Monday morning.  I’ve been working for over 8 hours today and I am HAPPY.  This was my first opportunity to show my mettle without strong support from the Flatiron School.  I was left to figure it out on my own.  

It took about 5 days to get here with the extra credit for generating a ruby Gem.

In the process, I abandoned the familiar Learn/Atom IDE in favor of nano and raw bash.  Then, I had to get personal with git.  The switch paid off and within 24 hours, I was working fast and furious.    

Continuing the adventure, my machine gave me trouble and I decided to re-image the hard drive with Ubuntu 18.04.  One day later, I knew a lot more about hardware and the machine is a lot better off too.

The effort started on Wednesday the 2nd of May.  It is now early morning Monday May 7th and I am code complete / gem complete.  The project pulls meteorological data from NOAA – https://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/ using SOAP.  Getting the SOAP piece up and running was fun.  I had never built a SOAP interface.  Research and development is rewarding.  There is nothing like the sight of flowing data to make a development student smile.  

In the app, the user decides when to query NOAA for New York Harbor tide and wind velocity data.  New information is posted every 6 minutes.  The user can elect basic information or add additional data points.  It is a clean text based interface and everything is easy to follow.

The Flatiron School will review the work – fingers crossed!  After standing in front of a fire-hose for 5 days, I am looking forward to a bite sized labs.

Many thanks to Josh Owens, Ann Heilman Murphy, and Lorraine Fenenbock (my Mom).  They are great sounding boards and I value the time that they have lent to me.
