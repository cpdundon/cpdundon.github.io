Hi – This was a good week coding.  I hit my milestones and had time to study algos / work on HackerRank problems.  The algo studying was not as bad as I expected it to be.  Way back when, I took a course on computer algorithms.  I probably understood 40% of it at the time.  Now those memories are coming in handy – providing a base to learn the meat of algorithm speed estimation.

Why was I so productive this week?  I think it comes down to discipline.  I worked on something important every day and stayed focused.  As a result, I brought the week in on time and on budget.

Please check my sprint cards below [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dT6-Y_PDX4rD-E3hAKP-anQ_oFOjTwil4rX66Uk9DqQ/edit#gid=0).

NOTE:  I used an API for my COVID-19 report [here](https://www.cpdundon.com/COVID-19).  If you pound on it, it locks out all report users.  The API will only serve an application a fixed rate of data.  Once we hit our quota, they cut us off for a while.  When I last checked, the site was receiving data.  Please do not keep pressing the get data button for no good reason.  

NOTE-NOTE:  I am going to fix the problem above by caching the API data in database under my control.  It is going to take a few weeks as I need to set up the right technology.  First and foremost, I need a DB on Lightsail and that is my next programming task.

I am headed back to AWS set-up land.  AWS documentation is strong and I am looking forward to pressing it into service.  Working solo freelance, requires a level of self reliance.  Right now, I do not have the budget for a support contract and expert advice.  I will be resourceful over the next couple of years and that is great.  

Goals for this week are similar to the ones for last week:  
* 4 HackerRank problems
* 8 Hours of algorithm study
* Nail the sprint card for the week
* One blog post

See you next week.  Please Stay Safe!
