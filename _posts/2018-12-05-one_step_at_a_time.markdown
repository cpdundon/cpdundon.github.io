The Good news – the code is complete for my Rails Voyage Tracker:

* https://github.com/cpdundon/rails_voyage_v01_02
* https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pdKjBbD0bxWu3-xF0h2anbBeBuhZkm0Z?ths=true
 
It took a while to get here – birthdays, holidays, etc.  A wise man once said to me “If you want to get something done, give it to a busy person.”  I’ve been busy – coding at 2am several times in the past week.  

For the last two weeks, I have:
* Coded
* Entertained visiting relatives
* Entertained sick relatives
* Visited out of town relatives
* Signed up for a exercise program (swimming) – woke up at 4am to stand in line and register at the Eisenhower Park Pool
* Thought about life  

I learned:
* I like software – it is fun again
* I like my relatives
* I am totally looking forward to my swim program
* Life is good
* Life would rock if I spent 2 more hours per day behind my laptop coding.  I am working on this.

Progress update:  I expect to be on the job market by early January with Flatiron School support.  I will have Rails under my belt and be competent with JavaScript.  Under this plan, I’ll finish the last quarter of the Flatiron program in the first two months of 2019.
